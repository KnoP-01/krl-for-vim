                        *krl-Introduction*

**READ |tl:dr| FIRST** if you want more than just syntax highlight and 
automatic indenting. It is a quick overview over the most important options and
mappings provided by KRL for Vim.

KRL for Vim (7.4 or later) is a collection of Vim scripts to help programing
KUKA industrial robots.

It provides
* syntax highlighting,
* indenting,
* folding,
* support for commentary [vimscript #3695], matchit [vimscript #39] and
  matchup [vimscript #5624],
* mappings and settings to navigate through code in a backup folder structure,
* text objects for functions and folds,
* optimized folding and concealing for viewing VRKC and
* completion of words from known or custom global files like $config.dat,
* mappings to insert a body of a new DEF, DEFFCT or DEFDAT based on user
  defined templates or hopefully sane defaults.

Note: Keep your files to be edited in one folder or in a regular robot
backup folder structure. KRL for Vim modifies 'path' accordingly. Since
version 2.0.0 KRC1 backups are supported too.  
Note to Linux users: Keep your files to be edited on a FAT file system. 
Some features need the case insensitive file system to work properly.

Short description:
------------------
Q: Since version 2.0.0 everything's weird. How so?  
A: Most optional features are enabled by default now.  

Q: I'm here to feed my kids, not to read. How do I get rid of stuff?  
A: Disable stuff in your |vimrc|, see |krl-options| for details: >

    let g:krlFormatComments = 0 " don't break comment lines automatically
    let g:krlCommentIndent = 1 " indent comments starting in 1st column too
    let g:krlShortenQFPath = 0 " don't shorten paths in quickfix
    let g:krlAutoComment = 0 " don't continue comments with o, O or Enter
    let g:krlSpaceIndent = 0 " don't change 'sts', 'sw', 'et' and 'sr'
    "let g:krlFoldLevel = 0 " switch folding off completely
    "let g:krlFoldLevel = 1 " close movement folds on startup (default)
    let g:krlFoldLevel = 2 " close all folds on startup
    let g:krlKeyWord = 0 " don't treat $, # and & as word char

Q: Which keys get mapped to what? Will that override my own mappings?  
A: krl-for-vim will not override existing mappings unless the corresponding
   option is explicitly set. To use different key bindings use the
   <PLUG>mapping. Otherwise krl-for-vim create the followin mappings: >

    <F2> Open all folds
    <F3> Open none movement folds
    <F4> Close all folds
            Depend on g:krlFoldLevel not existing or >=1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlFoldingKeyMap = 1

    gd Go to or show definition of variable or def/deffct.
            Does work on fold lines for SPSMAKRO, UP, bin, binin and Marker.
            Does override existing mappings and Vim's default.
            Disable override existing mapping and Vim's default with
        let g:krlGoDefinitionKeyMap = 0

    <leader>u List all significant appearances of word under cursor.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlListUsageKeyMap = 1

    <leader>f List all def/deffct of the current file.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlListDefKeyMap = 1

    [[ Move around functions. Takes a count.
    ]] Move around functions. Takes a count.
    [] Move around functions. Takes a count.
    ][ Move around functions. Takes a count.
    [; Move around comments. Takes a count.
    ]; Move around comments. Takes a count.
            Does override existing mappings and overshadow Vim's default.
            Disable override existing mapping and Vim's default with
        let g:krlMoveAroundKeyMap = 0

    if Inner function text object.
    af Around function text object.
    aF Around function text object including preceding comments.
            Depend on g:krlMoveAroundKeyMap not existing or >=1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlFunctionTextObject = 1

    io Inner fold text object. Takes a count for nested folds.
    ao Around fold text object. Takes a count for nested folds.
            Depend on matchit.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlFoldTextObject = 1

    ic Inner comment text object.
    ac Around comment text object.
            Depend on g:krlMoveAroundKeyMap not existing or =1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlCommentTextObject = 1

    <leader>n Inserts a new def/deffct.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:krlAutoFormKeyMap = 1

Q: Does krl-for-vim provide a mapping for indenting a complete file?  
A: No, but you may put the following in your .vimrc or
   `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/krl.vim`: >

    nnoremap ANYKEY gg=G``zz

Q: Does krl-for-vim provide a mapping to quickly switch between the
   corresponding dat- and src-file?  
A: No, but you may put the following in your .vimrc or
   `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/krl.vim`: >

    nnoremap ANYKEY :if expand('%')=~'\.dat$' <bar> e %:s?\.dat$?.src? <bar> else <bar> e %:s?\.src$?.dat? <bar> endif<CR>

Q: I did set g:krlFoldLevel=1 or 2 but folds are open after loading a .src
   file?!   
A: Unfortunately the order matters: >

    syntax on                   " before filetype plugin on
    filetype plugin indent on   " after syntax on

Q: Folds are still open although I have syntax on and filetype on in the right
   order?!  
A: Some plugin manager mess with those commands, so with vim-plug I had to
   redo this after plug#end(): >

    call plug#end()
    syntax off                  " undo what plug#begin() did to syntax
    filetype plugin indent off  " undo what plugin#begin() did to filetype
    syntax on                   " before filetype plugin on
    filetype plugin indent on   " after syntax on

Q: Scrolling feels sluggish. What can I do?  
A: Switch error highlighting off and/or folding to marker: >

    let g:krlFoldMethodSyntax = 0 " better performance, but case sensitive
    let g:krlShowError        = 0 " better performance

Q: Still sluggish!  
A: Switch syntax off or jump instead of scroll!  

Q: Where are the nice and informative messages?  
A: `:let g:knopVerbose=1` any time.

                        *krl-highlighting*
==============================================================================
                        *g:krlShowError*
g:krlShowError:
---------------

Disable error highlighting:  >
    let g:krlShowError = 0

If omitted or set to 1 a few syntax errors, mainly false usages of =, ==, <=
and >=, get highlighted. 
Note that this is not a syntax check.


Index: |krl-index|
                        *g:krlGroupName* 
g:krlGroupName:
---------------

Note: This option must be set before the colorscheme.

With this option reset krl-for-vim does |hi-link| 
krlBuildInFunction to |group-name| `Function`, 
krlContinue to `Statement`,
krlMovement to `Special` and
krlSysvars to nothing: >
    let g:krlGroupName = 0

With this option set krl-for-vim does |hi-link| 
krlBuildInFunction to |group-name| `BuildInFunction`, 
krlContinue to `Continue`, 
krlMovement to `Movement` and 
krlSysvars to `Sysvars`: >
    let g:krlGroupName = 1

If omitted this option is automatically set if you use colorscheme
tortus or tortusless and reset for any other colorscheme. 

This is usefull if you want to set your own colors for Sysvars, Movement,
Continue and/or BuildInFunction:  >
    highlight Sysvars           guibg=Black     guifg=white
    highlight BuildInFunction   guibg=Black     guifg=#00d5d5
    highlight Continue          guibg=black     guifg=#646423
    highlight Movement          guibg=black     guifg=green

`krlBuildInFunction`    contains KSS functions.
`krlSysvars`            contains all variables starting with $.
`krlContinue`           contains the continue instruction.
`krlMovement`           contains movement instructions like ptp, lin and
                      movement modifiers like c_ptp and c_dis.

If you like it colorful and dark background you may try the 
colorscheme tortus or tortusless which makes use of these groups:

                        *krl-indent*
==============================================================================
                        *g:krlSpaceIndent*
g:krlSpaceIndent:
-----------------

Disables the modification of 'softtabstop', 'expandtab', 'shiftwidth' 
and 'shiftround':  >
    let g:krlSpaceIndent = 0

If omitted or set to 1 the following Vim options get set:
    'softtabstop'   = 2
    'shiftwidth'    = 2
    'expandtab'
    'shiftround'

Keep in mind that space is rare and tabs look really awful on the teach
pendant.


Index: |krl-index|
                        *g:krlCommentIndent*
g:krlCommentIndent:
-------------------

Enable indent of line comments which start in the first column: >
    let g:krlCommentIndent = 1

This is default off for commented code like this: 
    wait for di_blubb
;    wait for di_bla or di_blubb
;    if di_bla then
;      do_bla()
;    endif
    do_blubb()

If omitted or set to 0 comments which start in the first column are not
indented.

This option may be changed any time and will take effect immediately.


Index: |krl-index|
==============================================================================
                        *krl-folding*
==============================================================================
                        *g:krlFoldLevel*
g:krlFoldLevel:
---------------

Set this option to 2 to have all folds closed on opening a file:  >
    let g:krlFoldLevel = 2

Set this option to 0 to switch folding off completely: >
   let g:krlFoldLevel = 0

If omitted or set to 1 the following folds get closed on opening a file: 
    Movement folds for regular KRC files and 
    second level folds for VKRC files except vw_usr_*. 

Switch quickly between fold level with |g:krlFoldingKeyMap|.

See also |fold-commands| and |g:krlFoldMethodSyntax|.


Index: |krl-index|
                        *g:krlFoldMethodSyntax*
g:krlFoldMethodSyntax:
----------------------

Use 'foldmethod' |fold-marker| instead of |fold-syntax|.  >
   let g:krlFoldMethodSyntax = 0

If omitted or set to 1 'foldmethod' syntax is used. 'foldmethod' marker
uses less performance, but is case sensitive and will catch less movement
folds.


Index: |krl-index|
                        *g:krlConcealFoldTail*
g:krlConcealFoldTail:
---------------------

Disable concealing of fold tail in VKRC files.  >
   let g:krlConcealFoldTail = 0

If omitted or set to 1 the part after the second ; in a fold line gets
concealed. This makes the logic in a PSPS legibly. E.g.: >
     ;FOLD 1: A9 = EIN 
instead of: >
     ;FOLD 1: A9 = EIN ;%{SE}%MKUKATPVW %CVW_SPS %VBOASG %P 2:A9 = EIN,3:BOASG

g:krlFoldingKeyMap:
-------------------

Note: These mappings depend on |g:krlFoldLevel| >= 1 or omitted.

Regular KRC files and vw_usr*:
    `<F2>`: Open all folds
    `<F3>`: Open none movement folds
    `<F4>`: Close all folds

VKRC FOLGE, UP and MAKRO:
    `<F2>`: Open all folds
    `<F3>`: Open first level folds
    `<F4>`: Close all folds

==============================================================================
                        *krl-jump-quickly*

Vim by itself provides a lot of nice features to get around quickly. Some of
those features depend on proper 'path' setting. Fortunatly krl-for-vim takes
care about that and more for you.

For the best experience keep your files below the `KRC/` or `R1/` folder.

Note to unix/linux users: Keep your files on a filesystem which ingores case
(e.g. FAT) or some of the following features may not work correctly.

ftplugin/krl.vim does set 'path', 'suffixes' and 'suffixesadd' to find files
within a regular KUKA backup folder structure. This is not only usefull for
commands like |:find|, |gf|, |^Wf| and the like but also necessary for some of
the following features.

You may instruct krl-for-vim not to change 'path' if you reset |g:krlPath|.
'suffixes' and 'suffixesadd' get their values unconditionally. 

Index: |krl-index|
==============================================================================
                        *g:krlGoDefinitionKeyMap*   *<Plug>KrlGoDef*
g:krlGoDefinitionKeyMap:
------------------------

Note: This mapping overshadows the default Vim command |gd|.

    `gd`: Jump to or shows variable or def/deffct declarations.

To force this mapping off and make Vims default available: >
    let g:krlGoDefinitionKeyMap = 0

Alternativ <plug> mapping: >
    augroup KrlGoDefMapping
    au!
    au FileType krl nmap <silent><buffer> ANYKEY <Plug>KrlGoDef
    augroup END

A succesful search for a file local declaration jumps there right away. Get
back where you were with |''|. A succesful search for a global declaration
opens the |quickfix-window|. 

This also works for `M`arkers, `Bin`, `BinIn`, `UP`s and `SPSMAKRO`s in fold
lines of `VKRC` files, e.g.: >
    ;FOLD 4: SPSMAKRO23 = M15
    ;ENDFOLD
    ;FOLD 5: bin1 ( EIN ) = binin1
    ;ENDFOLD
    ;FOLD UP1 = M33
    ;ENDFOLD

Works best with `:syntax on` and both |g:krlPath| and |g:krlKeyWord| omitted.

Limitations: See |krl-go-definition-bugs|.


Index: |krl-index|
                        *g:krlListUsageKeyMap*  *<Plug>KrlListUse*
g:krlListUsageKeyMap:
---------------------

    `<leader>u`: List all appearances, outside of enum declarations and comments 
                 (unless used in a vkrc file), of the word under the cursor 
                 in the |quickfix-window|.

To force this mapping if `<leader>u` is already mapped: >

Index: |krl-index|
                        *g:krlMoveAroundKeyMap*
g:krlMoveAroundKeyMap:
----------------------

Note: These mappings overshadow the default Vim commands 
|[[|, |]]|, |[]| and |][|!

[count]`[[`   Jumps backward to the next DEF/DEFFCT [count] times. Works in
            |Normal|-, |Visual|- and |Operator-pending|-mode, see |operator|. 
            In Normal-mode it respects 'wrapscan'.

[count]`]]`   Like [[ but jumps forward to the next DEF/DEFFCT.

[count]`[]`   Like [[ but jumps backward to the next END/ENDFCT.

[count]`][`   Like [[ but jumps forward to the next END/ENDFCT.

[count]`[;`   Like [[ but jumps backward to the start of current or, if in
            between, previous comment.

[count]`];`   Like [[ but jumps forward to the end of the current or, if in
            between, next comment.

To force these mappings off and make Vims default available: >
    let g:krlMoveAroundKeyMap = 0

Note that |g:krlFunctionTextObject| depend on these mappings.

If omitted or set to 1 paths longer than 40 characters in quickfix-window are
shortened with |pathshorten()|.

g:krlPath:
----------

Disables the modification of 'path': >
    let g:krlPath = 0

If omitted or set to 1 krl-for-vim tries to set 'path' to the root
`.../KRC/**` of a kuka backup.

Note: Many features of krl-for-vim depend on a proper 'path' setting.

Expected folder structure:

`KRC1`:         `KRC2+`:                                `VKRC`:
MaDa/         KRC/                                  KRC/
  +-R1/         +-R1/                                 +-R1/
  +-Steu/       |  +-Mada/                            |  +-Folgen/
PowerOn/        |  +-Program/                         |  +-Mada/
  +-R1/         |  |    +-`UpToTwo`/`SubFolders`/         |  +-Makros/
  +-Steu/       |  +-System/                          |  +-System/
                |  +-TP/                              |  +-UPs/
                |  +-`UpToThree`/`custom`/`folders`/        |  +-VW_User/
                +-STEU/                               +-STEU/      
                    +-Mada/                               +-Mada/  


krl-for-vim does looks up to 5 levels upward for a `KRC/` folder. If found
`/absolut/path/to/KRC/**` gets added to 'path'. See |starstar|.
If not found krl-for-vim looks up to 4 levels upward for `R1/` and 2 levels up
for `STEU/` folders. If found `/absolut/path/R1/**` and `/absolut/path/Steu/**`
gets added.
If not found krl-for-vim tries to find `Mada`, `Program`, `System` and `TP`. But it's 
best to work below a `KRC/` folder or have all files in the same directory.

Match it support:
-----------------
You may have to install the |matchit| plugin to use this. See |matchit-install|
for help on this. 
See also https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39
An alternative for matchit is |matchup|. 
See also https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5624

If |matchit| or |matchup| is loaded you can use |%| to not only jump between
(), [] and {} but also between >

Can't remember if the name of that variable was `$conf_mess` or `$confmess`?
No problem! Just insert `$con` and hit |i_CTRL-P| or |i_CTRL-N|. 

krl-complete adds known global data lists and src files to 'complete' as
{dict}. You may add your own global files, see |g:krlCompleteAdditions|.
The syntax file will also be added, so you can complete known KSS functions
and keywords.

    'runtimepath'/syntax/krl.vim

For this feature to work you need to start your edit below the
.../`KRC`/-folder or have all files you need in the same directory as the
current file. 

Enable |g:krlVerbose| to see what files are actually added.

      \'R1/Program/util/global_var.dat' , 
      \'R1/Program/util/global_fct.src']

Note that spaces in paths are fine, just don't use too fancy special
characters. Make sure to use forward slashes (`/`) as path separator, also on
Windows!

You should add the path relative to .../`KRC`. Even if you put all the files
you edit are in the same directory, they will be found. You may also add just
a file name, However, in that case the file will only be found if present in
the same directory as the current file. 

Enable |g:krlVerbose| to see what files are actually added.

See also |krl-complete|.

If omitted or set to 0 no custom files get added to complete.

                        *krl-auto-form*

With krl-for-vim you can quickly create a new DEF, DEFFCT or DEFDAT after your
liking. 

Type `<leader>n` anywhere in a *.src, *.sub or *.dat file. You will get prompted
on some details for the new body. The last prompt is the name. The name prompt
is mandatory, all others may be typed quickly after `<leader>n`. Hit <esc> or
enter an empty string at any prompt to abort.

Example: `<leader>ngfb` will insert a body for a new global function of type
bool.
Mnemonic: New Global Function of type Bool

If the type does not match the current file type (*.src, *.sub or *.dat), a
a new file with the given name is created. In case you want a new DEFDAT in a
*.src or vice versa.

The |User| group |autocmd-event| `KrlAutoFormPost` will be triggered after the
insertion is finished and may be used for further customization: >
    augroup KrlAutoForm
    au!
    au User KrlAutoFormPost call MyAutoFormPostFunc()

This list may seem overwhelming, but those mappings are quite logical and can
be used to skip the first few promps. After <leader>n just continue like you
would answer the prompts for "[g]lobal or [l]ocal?", "[d]ef, def[f]ct or
defd[a]t?" and "Datatype? [b]ool, [i]nt, [r]eal...".

Note: Mappings marked with * will have a little delay until they trigger.
